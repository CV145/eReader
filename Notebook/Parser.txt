What does the parser do?
- Extracts the raw HTML/XHTML content (contains formatting, links, and images)
- Extracts structure and metadata like book info, TOC, Chapter HTML, reading order (next/previous navigation),
and images

The parser doesn't just extract text.

An EPUB is essentially:

  EPUB = ZIP file containing:
  - HTML/XHTML files - The actual book
  content (chapters)
  - CSS files - Styling for the HTML
  - Images - Cover, illustrations, etc.
  (PNG, JPG, SVG)
  - Fonts - Custom typography (optional)
  - Metadata files - Book info, table of
  contents, structure

  The parser will exist in a shared folder that both frontends can refer to. The backend may parse too
  server-side, but I'm not sure I've seen this before usually an epub is parsed offline

Pagination and styling - Those are frontend responsibilities. The parser just provides the raw content, and each frontend (React web, React Native) will handle display differently.
