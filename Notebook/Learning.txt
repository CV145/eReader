Any new terms I learn and syntax go here.

UseCallback - what is this?
- useCallback is a hook that remembers a function so that it 
doesn't get recreated every time a component re-renders

useMemo
- A hook that remembers a value from a calculation so it 
doesn't have to be re-calculated every time a component
re-renders
