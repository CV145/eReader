My one big project. I will work on this until I get hired and show it to employers. This will be my "portfolio".

I plan to write this with Next.js and the express framework for the backend and React for the frontend. These are 2 big, popular technologies so that's why I chose them. I will also write extensive documentation for employers to look at and take a peek at my thought process.
